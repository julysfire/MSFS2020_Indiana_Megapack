#### Description
This will have many handcrafted handcrafted airports in 1 package with enhancements to scenery in Indiana!

Currently Included Airports
- KMCX - White County Airport, Monticello
- KOXI - Stark County Airport, Knox

#### Summary
I started with Neofly from my homestate of Indiana in my alma mater of Purdue University (KLAF).  Upon doing some flying to different smaller airports in Indiana, I noticed that a lot of the scenery and airports could use a bit love.  The goal of this megapack is to update a lot of the smaller Indiana airports as well as making Indiana look as close to real life as possible.  Due to the size of the scope of this project, I will be doing rolling updates on this site (the folder(s) above or in the ZIP will always be the most up to date from here) while the 3rd part websites (Flightsim.to and Nexusmods) will have periodic updates. 

#### Current Status
Working on getting a lot of vegetation up to date.  There aren't too many height updates.  Trying to not cover up houses and roads with trees.

Also, I will soon break out the scenery and individual airports into seperate folders so you will be able to pick and chose what you want in your community folder.


#### Features
- Hand crafted airports and scenery of surrounding area
- Plenty of GA parking spots at each airport
- Some water height level fixes along the Tippacanoe river.
- Added **lots** of vegetation where auto generated spots failed.  It seems the auto generated vegetation stops working in rural areas and near houses.
- Realistic look and feel
- Realistic night lighting around the hangars/runway/aprons

If you enjoyed it as well and would like to donate, it is very much appreciated but never will be required.  I am doing this to add to the community's total assets of airports and scenery and because honestly, I found I really enjoy doing this.  I only strive to make content that others can enjoy.
