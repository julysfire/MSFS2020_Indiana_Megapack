#### Summary
I started with Neofly from my homestate of Indiana in my alma mater of Purdue University (KLAF).  Upon doing some flying to different smaller airports in Indiana, I noticed that a lot of the scenery and airports could use a bit love.  The goal of this megapack is to update a lot of the smaller Indiana airports as well as making Indiana look as close to real life as possible.  Due to the size of the scope of this project, I will be doing rolling updates on this site (the folder(s) above or in the ZIP will always be the most up to date from here) while the 3rd part websites (Flightsim.to and Nexusmods) will have periodic updates.

This will be a rolling release.  Files from here will always be up to date. 3rd Party websites will have periodic updates.


#### Current Status
Working on getting a lot of vegetation up to date.  There aren't too many height updates.  Trying to not cover up houses and roads with trees.

I have a list of airports so far that I would like to work on so I'll be going through that list.


#### Features
- Hand crafted airports and scenery of surrounding area.
- Plenty of GA parking spots at each airport.
- Some water height level fixes along the Tippacanoe river.
- Additional water fixes of rivers/lakes/ponds/streams not counting as water.
- Added **lots** of vegetation and water where auto generated spots failed.  Also fixed a lot of issues where additional vegetation was spawning where it was not supposed to (biggest issue is on top of power lines, on railroad tracks, on roads, or in fields).
- Current Amount of vegetation/height/water fixes: **3893**.
- Realistic look and feel.
- Realistic night lighting around the hangars/runway/aprons.

#### ---Installation Instructions---

I have opted for a structure that will make this pack as modular as possible.  Each folder above is going to be a different airport/scenery item.  The above folders are the items that go into your Community folder.  This means you can mix and match any airport sets you want.  While not required, I recommend the vegetation/height folder (any airport dependent terrain corrections are housed in their airport's folder).


1. Download the .zip file and extract the .zip folder.  Alternatively, you can download everything (at the top, Click the green Code button and Download ZIP).
2. Move the desired folders into your Microsoft Flight Simulator Community Folder.  This will allow you to have a choice of which airports to include.  Each airport is within it's own folder.

## Example of Vegetation Updates
### A lot of vegetation is not reconigzed in the Sim and is manually updated.  This is done all around the state.

If you enjoyed it as well and would like to donate, it is very much appreciated but never will be required.  I am doing this to add to the community's total assets of airports and scenery and because honestly, I found I really enjoy doing this.  I only strive to make content that others can enjoy.
