##### Description
Many handcrafted handcrafted airports in 1 package!

- KMCX - White County Airport, Monticello
- KOXI - Stark County Airport, Knox

##### Summary
I started with Neofly from my homestate of Indiana in my alma mater of Purdue University (KLAF).  Upon doing some flying to different smaller airports in Indiana, I noticed that a lot of the scenery and airports could use a bit love.  The goal of this megapack is to update a lot of the smaller Indiana airports. 

##### Features
- Hand crafted airports and scenery of surrounding area
- Plenty of GA parking spots at each airport
- Some water height level fixes along the Tippacanoe river.
- Added vegetation where auto generated spots failed.  It seems the auto generated vegetation stops working in rural areas.  Going to try to add as much as possible to be closer to real life.
- Realistic look and feel
- Realistic night lighting around the hangars/runway/aprons

If you enjoyed it as well and would like to donate, it is very much appreciated but never will be required.  I am doing this to add to the community's total assets of airports and scenery and because honestly, I found I really enjoy doing this.  I only strive to make content that others can enjoy.
